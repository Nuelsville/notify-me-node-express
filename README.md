git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```dotenv
# General Config
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Database Config
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_NAME=your-database-name
